# 🌦️ Python Fundamentals Project – Weather Tracker

The Weather Tracker is an interactive Python application designed to record, store, and analyze local weather data. The application allows users to log daily weather observations, view statistics, search records, and even forecast tomorrow’s weather based on historical trends.

This project was built as part of the Python Fundamentals Project, focusing on collaboration, version control, and applying core Python programming concepts.


## 🚀 Features

### 1. Record a New Weather Observation:
+ Input date in MM-DD-YYYY format.
+ Record temperature in °C.
+ Enter weather conditions (e.g., Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy, Snowy).
+ Enter humidity (%) and wind speed (km/h).
+ Saves all observations into a CSV file.

### 2. View Weather Statistics:
+ Calculate average, minimum, and maximum temperatures.
+ Display the most common weather condition.
+ Generate temperature trends with text-based graphs.

### 3. Search Data:
+ **By date**: Display all observations from a specific date.
+ **By temperature** Find records within ±0.5°C of a given temperature.
+ **By condition**: Search by weather condition with summary statistics.
+ **By season**: Filter and analyze data by season.

### 4. Forecasting:
+ Predict tomorrow’s temperature based on the last 7 days of data.

### 5. View All Observations:
+ Display all weather records in a formatted table.

### 6. Yearly Comparison:
+ Compare current year vs. previous year statistics.
+ Track record-breaking temperatures or conditions.
## 🛠️ Technical Details:

- Built with **Python**
- Data stored in **CSV files**
- Includes both **Jupyter Notebook** (for demo & exploration) and **Python scripts** (.py) for modular code
- Clear function design with docstrings, comments, and naming conventions

### 📦 Libraries Used:
- **csv** → for reading and writing weather records in CSV format
- **datetime (date, datetime, timedelta)** → for handling dates and calculating trends/forecasts
- **pandas** → for managing, filtering, and analyzing tabular weather data
- **os** → for file handling and directory operations
- **colorama** → for adding colors to terminal output (better user experience)
- **collections.Counter** → for identifying the most common weather conditions
